lodash -> Lodash is a JavaScript library that provides a collection of utility functions for common programming tasks. It builds upon the older Underscore.js library, offering a wider range of methods and a more modular structure.

axios -> Axios is a JavaScript library used to make HTTP requests from the browser or a Node.js server. It is similar to the fetch API, but it offers a more powerful and flexible way of making HTTP requests.
